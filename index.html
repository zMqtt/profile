    <h3>More about me</h3>
    <p>
      I am 22 years old, living in the South East of England. I am currently enrolled in and enjoying my
      time learning to code with <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Le Wagon</a>
    </p>
    <h3>My interests</h3>
    <p>
      Spending time with my beautiful girlfriend is one of my greatest joys. Whether we're hitting
      the gym, playing badminton, swimming, or taking long, leisurely walks, our shared activities
      bring us closer and fill our days with fun and laughter. We love to explore new places together,
      traveling whenever we get the chance, and car shows are a particular favorite of ours,
      blending my passion for cars with our shared adventures. My interest in cars extends to my
      hobbies too. I enjoy immersing myself in racing games on my PC, complete with a steering
      wheel setup for a more authentic experience. Beyond that, I'm a fan of action-packed
      gaming sessions in the worlds of Call of Duty and Battlefield, where I can unwind and dive
      into thrilling virtual battles.
